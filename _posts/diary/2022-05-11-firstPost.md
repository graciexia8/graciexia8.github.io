Welcome to my new site! 

I wanted to move off Adobe portfolio and create a longer lasting space where I have full customization of everything.

This website was made using Jekyll. I remember when I was 18, I tried to learn Jekyll but became too overwhelmed by the documention. This time, it took me only a day to understand! I guess I've grown as a programmer :)

I don't have much to write for this first post.

But I am looking forward to crafting out this site into something personal, fun, and memorable.
