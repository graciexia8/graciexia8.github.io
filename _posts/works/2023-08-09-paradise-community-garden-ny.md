In 2022, I became involved in the NYC urban gardening community. Through this experience I became a NYC Master Composter and now I help run logistics for Paradise Community Garden NY in Jamaica, Queens. My day-to-day involvement includes graphic design (e.g. logo design, business card), running the garden social media, helping out with our compost program and corresponding with local schools/organizations to develop community events and partnerships with the garden. I also co-own a garden bed and am learning to grow my own vegetables.
