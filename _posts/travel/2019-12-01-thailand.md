Thailand was an accumulation of all the tips, tricks and travel advice I had acquired over the course of 2019 and I was ready to put forth my knowledge to the test. I went into this vacation alone with no prior plans or specific destinations in mind.

Traveling alone was a magnificently rewarding experience. I started off my journey in the southern part of Thailand, in Phuket Island.

Phuket’s tourism infrastructure is very developed so I had virtually no issue getting around. Travel was done mainly by Grab, buses, and on the back of motorbikes.

Of course, I had the chance to visit Phuket’s beaches and islands, however, I found myself enjoying the town itself a lot more. There were certainly areas where tourists filled the streets, but off the beaten path Phuket was had a nice charm to it.

I chose to stay in the Vitamin Sea Hostel near Phuket’s old town. Vitamin Sea boasted a wide selection of cafe drinks, quirky furniture pieces and unfiltered golden hour light topped off with the fun-loving people who owned the hostel.

I remember one night, the owners had invited all of us at the hostel out to watch performances at a local bar. It just so happened that, that night, all the guests who tagged along were girls, which was really refreshing.

Staying there allowed me to form some really meaningful connections with all the guests there as well.

We spent nights and nights just discussing our lives, love, our futures even though I’d only befriended them a few days prior. It was a brief but magical friendship.

The hostel owners Tian and May also drove us to the different cafes they often visited. A lot of them were hidden away from the main streets of Phuket so we were able to get a taste of what locals enjoyed.

Before we all parted ways, May and Tian actually cooked us lunch to say goodbye. It was a touching gesture. Definitely one of the highlights of my time in Thailand.

Not long after, I hopped on a bus headed towards Chiang Mai. (Buses are a fraction of the cost of Taxis, so if you can, ride those!)

Chiang Mai is located in Thailand’s north. While Phuket was lively, bustling, and a bit noisy, Chiang Mai offered a tranquil contrast.

The weather in Chiang Mai was closer to Canadian June. The crisp air and chirping of birds only added to atmosphere of serenity there.

It had just so happened that Chiang Mai was hosting its design week while I was there. Design week was an outdoor exhibition in the old town that showcased the works of Thai and Asian designers. Going around and exploring their pieces allowed me to explore the old town with more depth.

The first hostel I stayed at didn’t actually have any people so I spent my first few days in Chiang Mai visiting various cafes and just catching up on unfinished work.

I dined in My Secret Cafe in Town and Passion Project Cafe.

The baristas and chefs there really knew how to cater to the North American palate.

Of course, no trip near the mountains is complete without a hike. I signed myself up for a walk down the Kew Mae Pan towards Doi Inthanon. Fun fact, my tour guide for the hike used to work as a bartender and once served Bradley Cooper drinks when they were filming the Hangover.

I had enjoyed the city so much, I actually extended my stay. I switched to another hostel. There I convinced someone to let me on the back of their motorbike. We went on an adventure into the Doi Suthep mountains due to its proximity.

My new hostel had a lot of people closer to my age so it was easier to make friends as well. We rode up to Doi Suthep and enjoyed a sunset.

Chiang Mai’s old town valued artisan-ship. Around every corner, I found specialty stores with handcrafted artifacts, vintage fashion, jewelry stores, and cafes.

All over Thailand, there were these massive markets sprawling with street food, crafts, and fashion. Chiang Mai was no exception. You could probably spend an entire night walking down the night markets there and still have more left to see.

Looking back this is probably my most memorable travel. I didn’t feel alone at all. I met so many interesting people along the way, this was a true vacation.
