*Overlooking the snowy streets of Oslo*

It was over there, where I had the chance to experience my first taste of what it meant to be completely free, to be so far away, to interact with different kinds of people, and forget the reality that I was living in back in Canada. For that, I am thankful for the four-month adventure that seemed a lifetime away.

Norway also marked a great shift within my personal life and making a decision that was purely for myself. Rather than writing about what I did there, I’ve instead curated a collection of images that I hope represent my time in Oslo.

The underlying theme I’ve tried to evoke is “a slice of life in the city of Oslo”.
