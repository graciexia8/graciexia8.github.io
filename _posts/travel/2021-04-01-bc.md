description: "Work took me to the beautiful province of British Columbia in the summer of 2021. Having grown up in Canada, I had never set foot on the west coast. The dramatic landscapes and scenery were quite different from that of home in the shield. From snow-capped mountains to the open ocean, this province definitely knew what to bring. Here are some snippets from my time in British Columbia."
