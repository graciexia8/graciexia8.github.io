subtitle: "Winter Pandemic Adventures"
description: "This term, Joyce (one of my oldest friends) and I moved to Montreal Quebec. Joyce and I met when we were twelve years old. Throughout our decade of friendship, we always talked about living in a city together in our 20 somethings. With university graduation impending, a realization hit that there would probably only be a small chance where we'd end up in the same vicinity for work after graduating. So we took advantage of the remote work situation, rented a car, and drove ourselves from Toronto to Montreal. The two of us masked up in Montreal and survived through another long Canadian winter in style. The pictures below presents as proof of us fulfilling one of our childhood dreams."
