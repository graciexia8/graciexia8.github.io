description: "My third internship took me to the island of Singapore. Living there, I felt a sense of familiarity in culture, food and behaviour. In my household, mixing languages was a result of immigration and assimilation, but the melding of east and west seemed be a norm in this nation. Below are some photo collections of my time in Singapore."
