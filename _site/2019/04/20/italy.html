          <h2>Italy</h2>
          <h4>Altrani, Almafi, Ravello, Positano, Pompeii</h4>
          <p>I spent a week and a half in the southern region of Italy wandering the steps of the Amalfi coastline. Travel has always been a luxury for me, so this was a privilege and something I’m extremely thankful for.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p><img src="/assets/images/travel/italy/1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The Amalfi is located approximately 2.5 hours southeast from the city of Naples. I got to the coast by first taking a train from Naples to Salerno and then a bus ride from Salerno to Altrani. I had to ask for help along the way to get to my destination as I had no prior plans. We were basically driving through a cliff-side to get to Altrani so you can imagine the excitement I had during that bus ride.</p>

<p>I was staying at this older couple’s home in the town. I remember tirelessly dragging my luggage up the flights of stairs and winding corridors, but then getting lost in the maze of houses. I think it was there that I decided, I would live out of a backpack next time.</p>

<p>The good thing was, at almost every alleyway I was greeted by these feline creatures. I’m not sure why there were so many cats.</p>

<p>Altrani is a 10-minute walk from the town of Amalfi, so as soon as I checked in, that became my next destination. Amalfi was the pinnacle of picturesque travel. Shining blue waters, striking cliffs, architecture built on the side of the mountains. It was an absolute wonder.</p>

<p>The town itself was a tourist hot-spot. Restaurants, gift shops, cheese shops, and lemon specialty stores lined the alleyways of Amalfi. The southern part of Italy was known for its lemon production. I saw Limoncello stalls, lemon sorbet, and Cedro citrons everywhere!</p>

<p>I also had the chance to explore the surrounding towns. There were staircases all along the cliffs so you could walk from one town to the next.</p>

<p>It was no joke, I climbed along the ridges of the Amalfi, saw restaurants built within caves and accidentally trespassed into someone’s lemon garden.</p>

<p>Making a brief stop in the town of Ravello, I was able to buy some souvenirs and witness a full-blown Italian wedding with church bells, popes and flowers tossed into the air.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/travel/italy/9.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Not so far from Ravello was the Terrazza Dell’Infinito. It was a villa built to mimic the gods that had lived there. From the villa, you had full access to the sight of the Mediterranean sea below. I had somehow trekked all the way from the seashore to the top of the coast to get there.</p>

<p>I had also signed myself up for a hike along the trail called the “Path of the gods”. There were a lot of tourists but the sight did not disappoint.</p>

<p>One of my most memorable impressions was going into a butcher shop, ordering a sandwich and watching the shop owner make it from her selection of cured meat, tomatoes, and Parmesan slices. Even though I enjoyed the endless supply of pasta, the simplicity of that meal will be what I remember about my trip there.</p>

<p>The last thing I had the chance to partake in was kayaking along the sea. We were able to visit hidden shorelines, grottos’, and learn a bit more about how the Amalfi has changed due to human development throughout time.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/travel/italy/13.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>That trip ended with a visit to the city of Pompeii. With Mt.Vesuvius looming over us, I couldn’t help but think what would’ve happened if it had exploded then and there once more. At least I would’ve died living my life to the fullest.</p>
